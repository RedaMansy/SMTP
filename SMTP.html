	<h2> <a name="History"></a> History </h2>
		<p> At the time of its defintition by Jonathan Postel in 1892, the internet was minute compared to its vastness today. <br> It was merely a collection of military installations, universities as well as corporate research labs. <br> The number of hosts was so small, that all of the participants could recognize each other. <br> Due to the internet's size, there was further emphasis on reliability rather than security. <br> Users mostly configured their mail servers as open relays which meant that any of them could accept mail meant for other systems and pass it on until it reached its destination.  </p>
