		<p> TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. <br> It is the communication protocol used for the internet and similar networks.<br> Its main function is to control and manage data transmission over the internet. <br> It also provides end to end data communication that specifies how data should be packetized, adressed, transmitted, routed and received. <br> There are four abstraction layers to this functionality. They are: </p>
		<dl>
			<dt> <h3> Link Layer </h3> </dt>
			<dd> Contains methods of communication for data that remains within a single network segment</dd>
			<dt> <h3> Internet Layer </h3> </dt>
			<dd> Provides internetworking between independent networks</dd>
			<dt> <h3> Transport Layer </h3> </dt>
			<dd> Handles host-to-host communication</dd>
			<dt> <h3> Application Layer </h3> </dt>
			<dd> Provides process-to-process data exchange for applications</dd>
		</dl>
	<h2> <a name="History"></a> History </h2>
		<p>TCP/IP was designed in te 1970s DARPA <!---insert link and try to make it like wikipedia where you can hover over it -->scientists, Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf. Due to their design, they've often been refered to as <i>the fathers of the Internet</i>. While working at the IPTO, Kahn realized the need for the development of an open-architecture network model, where any network could communicatew with any other independent of individual hardware and software configuration. He had four goals in mind:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Network Connectivity </li>
				<ul>
					<li> A network should be able to connect to another through a gateway </li>
				</ul>
			<li> Distribution </li>
				<ul>
				<li> There would be no central network </li>
				</ul>
			<li> Error Recovery </li>
				<ul>
					Lost packets would be transmitted
				</ul>
			<li> Black-box Design </li>
				<ul>
					No changes would have to be made to a network to connect to another
				</ul>
		</ul>
